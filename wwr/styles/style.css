/*Responsive Design. One of the key parts to a responsive design is a @media query. These let us change our CSS based on the width of the browser window and other things as well. Media queries always need to be after all the other CSS. Don't add any CSS after the media query later either. This could be read as follows: "If the max width of the screen gets smaller than 900px, then use this CSS instead of what you may have seen above" for these selectors.
This CSS will not go into effect unless the screen is less than 900px;
Some grids were turned off with display: block, and the flex-boxes were changed from rows to columns. The rest is all minor adjustments to make it look good on the smaller screen.
You may notice display: none was used on a few selectors to make them disappear. Those elements weren't necessary, and not having them on a smaller screen makes it look less cluttered.*/
