                <h2>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h2>
                <p>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over 
                    the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are 
                    all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat 
                    for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are 
                    rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around 
                    any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped 
                    with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling 
                    stories...some of which are even true!</p>

                <h2>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h2>
                <p>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your 
                    safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years 
                    of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
                    Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation 
                    device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you 
                    an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for 
                    and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</p>

                <h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
                <p>The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes in the Canyon is to be prepared 
                    for both hot & dry and cold & wet Rain jacket and rain pants- do not bring ponchos Quick dry shirts 
                    and shorts long sleeve cotton shirt and pants- helps keep you cooler on hot days. Button down shirts 
                    provide more sun protection on the neck Light Weight Cotton Pant, Nylon Pant or Sarong the best 
                    thing for men to wear are swim trunks as shorts if you are cold natured, bring polypropylene long 
                    underwear top and bottom Women wear swim suits or quick dry underwear and sport bras as a base layer 
                    during the day. Over the base layer, wear a pair of quick dry shorts and the shirt of your 
                    choice (polypropylene if you are cold, cotton if you are hot). </p>

                <h2>How far in advance should I book my trip?</h2>
                <p>If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 
                    months in advance is usually sufficient.</p>

                <h2>What is great about whitewater rafting anyway?</h2>
                <p>Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the river.
                    Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. 
                    Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and 
                    prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, 
                    geology, stories, and more good food. </p>
