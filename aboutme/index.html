    <p>Hi there. I am Rocio, and I live in Olympia, WA. I am a wife and a mother of five. My first three
        children are married, so I have three tiny grandchildren, but two more are coming in a few months. 
        My two single sons are students at BYU in Provo, Utah. I hope they get married whenever they find 
        their eternal companion.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church for 42 years, so I am in my fifties and very eager to obtain 
        higher education. Achieving it is my goal! Because after this life, the acquired knowledge is the 
        only thing I will take with me. So, I am just starting my junior year at BYUI. I am approaching 
        to get a bachelor’s degree in the near future.</p>
    <p>I am excited to start a new semester and get to know you!</p>
